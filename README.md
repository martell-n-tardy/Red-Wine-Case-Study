# Linear-Regression-Case-Study
This case study uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine by modeling several linear regression models with varying parameters.

## Tools and Editors
* Jupyter Notebook
* Anaconda Prompt

## Libraries
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Sklearn, and Warnings

## Case Study Involved
* Choosing a dependent variable
* Visualizing correlations
* Train/Test split
* Creating Linear Regression Model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
* Creating Linear Regression Model: multiple linear regression
* Creating Linear Regression Model: avoiding redundancy
* Evaluating and Conluding: Which model perfomed best and other regression algorithms
